[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/americanexpress/one-app-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/americanexpress/one-app-router)

> One App Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code
> loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in.
> Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.

> One App Router was forked from [React Router v3](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3)
> as it provided the best initial fit. This is not meant to be a generic standalone Routing library but
> one which will be tailored for use with the One ecosystem.

## ü§π‚Äç Usage

### Installation
```
$ npm install @americanexpress/one-app-router
```

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, use as you would anything else:

```js
// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel
import { Router, Route, Link } from '@americanexpress/one-app-router'

// not using an ES6 transpiler
var Router = require('@americanexpress/one-app-router').Router
var Route = require('@americanexpress/one-app-router').Route
var Link = require('@americanexpress/one-app-router').Link
```

### See it in action

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Router, Route, Link, browserHistory } from '@americanexpress/one-app-router';

function App() {/*...*/}
function About() {/*...*/}
function NoMatch() {/*...*/}

async function getUsersFragment() {/*...*/}
async function findUserById() {/*...*/}

function Users({ children }) {
  const [users, setUsers] = React.useState([]);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    getUsersFragment().then(setUsers);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <div className="master">
        <ul>
          {/* use Link to route around the app */}
          {users.map(user => (
            <li key={user.id}>
              <Link to={`/user/${user.id}`}>{user.name}</Link>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="detail">
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function User({ params }) {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState(null);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    findUserById(params.userId).then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return user && (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      {/* etc. */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Declarative route configuration (could also load this config lazily
// instead, all you really need is a single root route, you don't need to
// colocate the entire config).
render((
  <Router history={browserHistory}>
    <Route path="/" component={App}>
      <Route path="about" component={About}/>
      <Route path="users" component={Users}>
        <Route path="/user/:userId" component={User}/>
      </Route>
      <Route path="*" component={NoMatch}/>
    </Route>
  </Router>
), document.getElementById('root'))
```
